xVasFMC
================

This project is a fork from the well-known FMC for MSFS/X-Plane vasfmc. The objectives
of this project are:

* A destilled version of VasFMC, with only the goal of working in X-Plane. 
* Assisting more than overtaking control.
* Only be a FMS nothing else.

Compiling
=================
* Tested with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010 Express and Qt SDK 1.2.1. Can be done
by simply open the project files in Qt Creator and building, first vaslib, then vasfmc
and then xpfmccoonn21.

This is a spare-time project for me, which means that i am only dedicating a few hours per
week for this project, so don't expect miracles.
